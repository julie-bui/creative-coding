** Description of project:** 
- The dataset represents data collected over a week of dance lessons, with the first column representing the duration of the dance lesson, second column representing length of the choreography and the third column represents the number of people in class. 

- Each row of the data represents a ball and the colours change randomly when the space bar is pressed. The starting position of the ball is dependant on the x and y values of the first and second column and the size of the ball is dependent on the third column.

- Each stickman represents each day of the week where data is collected, monday to sunday respectively. The heads of the stickman can change colours when the keys 1 to 7 are pressed, with the numbers representing the days of the week, 1 being monday and 7 being sunday. 

- The colours represent the emotion felt for the dance lesson, the darker the colour the more negative the emotion e.g. feeling tired/frustrated/stressed for not being able to keep up with choreo. The lighter the colour, the more positive the emotion, e.g. feeling happy/having fun.
